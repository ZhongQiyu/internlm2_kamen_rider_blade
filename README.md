# internlm2_kamen_rider_blade

This is a repository for a multi-agent-based question-answering system for the final project in InternLM Bootcamps.

The system mirrors the stage of Kamen Rider Blade (仮面ライダー剣 in 2004) to provide virtual but real-time user experience.

This also works as a follow-up work for the thesis projects of the author done over the past few years.
